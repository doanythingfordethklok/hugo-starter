This is a starter kit for Hugo which sets up a simple layout and website template with minimal boilerplate. The boilerplate that is here is opinionated and includes

- SASS build and home html template
- sanitize.css for CSS reset and system font stack
- includes the materializeCSS color mixin b/c I really like it.
- includes some basic core styles for flex layout
- Elm src folders and build processes for dynamic components.
